# PolyVCF

This program estimates several metrics of nucleotide polymorphism from a VCF file on a sliding window basis.

## Requirements

It strictly depends on the Python `pysam` [library](https://pysam.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html), which can be easily installed with pip

    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install pysam
    
or conda.

    conda install pip
